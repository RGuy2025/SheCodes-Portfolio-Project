      <strong>My Journey to Coding</strong> Growing up in an area and time where computers were not widely available, I
      never thought I would be here. I was used to doing everything by hand and without the use of computers.
      Any time I tried to use computers I would get frustrated and just want to stop. I resisted the new technology and
      always claimed that technology and I never got along.
      Through the years I stuck with jobs that were physically demanding and involved as little computer work as
      possible.
      However, as I moved into different industries that embrased different technologies, I began to get accustomed to
      utilizing various systems.
      I eventually ended up in customer service and that is where I realized I had been wrong about computers. In my
      customer service position, I needed to use multiple programs, problem-solving along the way. And to my surprise, I
      not only was good at it, but I enjoyed it!
      Due to an unfortunate (fortunate?) bone break, I was off work and stuck in bed. Thus my journey to SheCodes
      began...
      <br>
      I realized I wanted more to do with computers and so I looked into jobs that would be in demand and courses that
      could help get me there.
      Out of all the coding courses I found available to me, I was drawn to SheCodes. Matt Delac answered any questions
      I
      had about the course and knowing I could go at my own pace, plus had access to help from others, was reassuring
      that
      I would not get left behind if I
      struggled to understand a lesson. On top of all the personal benefits, knowing that part of my tuition goes to
      help
      other women gain training to better themselves made me feel like I was apart of a global community!
      Today I continue to take on new challenges to further my skills, remembering that it is never too late to try
      something new!
